# Baseline drift and intentional differences

F01 inventory baseline: `20109f9083babd014971951e8c02565ae51c2326`.
Original planning baseline: `2a995f964757df77693747b232aa47738c0c58cc`.

## Observed changes

| Baseline interval | Observation | Parity impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planning baseline → F01 baseline | Experiment report and rewrite planning documents merged; no changes in `slopsearx/` or `engines/` | No runtime capability changes; inventory uses the newer full repository revision |
| F01 baseline → `b7b79ab6` (observed while F01 was in review) | Three experiment Markdown documents changed in PR #949 | No source, dependency, workflow, executable or historical Python artifact changes; pinned inventory stays at its declared baseline |

| F01 merged `2e0026b4` → `6aa33a16` (observed during F02) | PR #951 changed 29 experiment Markdown/JSON registration and evidence files | No runtime, dependency, workflow or Python-source changes; architecture and pinned F01 source inventory remain applicable |

## Drift procedure

1. Fetch upstream and follow AGENTS.md session synchronization rules.
2. Compare the last accepted inventory baseline against the new source revision
   with `git diff --name-status OLD..NEW` and inspect changed implementations,
   public declarations, tests, scripts and executable workflow commands.
3. Add or revise capability, Python-disposition and invocation rows; assign a
   plan owner to every addition. Record removed or changed contracts explicitly.
4. Review omitted/null/empty/error semantics and durable bytes/clock behavior.
   Do not normalize a newly observed difference into the replay oracle silently.
5. Update this ledger with the interval, source changes, decisions and affected
   issues. Modify issue scope and dependencies together when needed.
6. Validate exact source-set coverage, owner IDs, source/test references and
   dependency acyclicity before accepting the new baseline. A missing capability
   or unclassified executable blocks acceptance.

F03/F04 will carry this inventory into the native check and replay commands.
Until then, acceptance requires source-set comparison and recorded review;
there is no claim that native parity has been implemented.

## Intentional differences

None implemented or accepted by F01. Proposed hardening in the case study must
receive an explicit ADR, affected contract updates and evidence before it is
counted as an accepted parity difference. Migration of an internal cache
namespace must not implicitly change durable artifact identities.
